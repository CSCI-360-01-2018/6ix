# Vision

This project is intended to emulate the software controlling a dual-alarm AM/FM clock radio. To this end, the user should be able to interact with the software in the same way they would be able to interact with a real object of the same purpose. These interactions include, but are not limited to:

1. configure and activate two distinct alarms
1. checking and setting the current time
1. tuning and using an internal clock radio
